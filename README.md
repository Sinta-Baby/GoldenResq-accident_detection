# GoldenResq-  — Golden Hour Response System

> AI-powered real-time road accident detection and multi-agency emergency alert system 
> Saving lives by acting within the critical Golden Hour*

---

##  Overview

GoldenResq- is an intelligent emergency response system that uses computer vision to automatically detect road accidents from CCTV footage and instantly dispatch alerts to hospitals, police, and ambulance services — all within seconds.

The system is built around the concept of the **Golden Hour**: the critical 60-minute window after a traumatic accident where immediate medical intervention dramatically increases survival rates.

##  Key Features

- Real-Time Accident Detection** — YOLOv8-powered vehicle detection with 3-layer accident analysis
- Multi-Hospital Alert System — Simultaneously notifies multiple hospitals with a one-click case acceptance link
- SMS Alert** — Instant Twilio SMS to emergency responders
- Automated Voice Call— Twilio voice call with accident details
- Police Notification— Automatic email alert to police with location
- Accident Snapshot — Auto-captures and attaches the accident frame to all emails
-  Google Maps Integration — Location link included in every alert
-  Audio Alarm — Browser-based voice alert on accident detection
-  Event Log — Full session history of all detected incidents

## 🧠 How Accident Detection Works

The detector uses **3 independent layers** to confirm an accident before triggering alerts — eliminating false positives:

| Layer | Method | Trigger |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Sudden Impact Motion | Large pixel change between frames (score > 18) |
| 2 | Vehicle Bounding Box Overlap | Two vehicles' boxes overlap by > 15% |
| 3 | Sudden Direction Change | Vehicle center jumps > 45px in 2 frames |

An alert is only fired when **2+ consecutive frames** confirm an accident.

##  Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/safeai.git
cd safeai
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up your `.env` file
Create a `.env` file in the root folder:
```env
# Twilio
TWILIO_SID=your_twilio_sid
TWILIO_TOKEN=your_twilio_token
TWILIO_PHONE=+1xxxxxxxxxx
EMERGENCY_PHONE=+91xxxxxxxxxx

# Gmail
EMAIL_SENDER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password

# Police
POLICE_EMAIL=police@example.com

# Hospitals
HOSPITAL_1=hospital1@example.com
HOSPITAL_2=hospital2@example.com
HOSPITAL_3=hospital3@example.com

# Public URL (ngrok or Streamlit Cloud URL)
APP_URL=https://your-app-url.streamlit.app
```

### 5. Generate audio alert
```bash
python generate_alerts.py
```

### 6. Run the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🔑 API Setup Guide

### Gmail (Email Alerts)
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Google account
2. Go to **Google Account → Security → App Passwords**
3. Generate an App Password and use it as `EMAIL_PASSWORD`

### Twilio (SMS & Voice Call)
1. Sign up at [twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com)
2. Get your **Account SID**, **Auth Token**, and a **Twilio phone number**
3. For trial accounts, verify all recipient numbers at [Twilio Verified Numbers](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/verified)

---

## 🌐 Making the Accept Link Public

The hospital accept link in emails must point to a **publicly accessible URL**, not `localhost`.

**Option 1 — Streamlit Cloud (Recommended, Free)**
1. Push project to GitHub
2. Deploy at [streamlit.io/cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
3. Set `APP_URL=https://your-app.streamlit.app` in Secrets

**Option 2 — ngrok (Local Testing)**
```bash
ngrok http 8501
# Copy the https URL and set APP_URL in .env
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open the app in your browser (`http://localhost:8501`)
2. Upload an accident video (MP4 or AVI) from the sidebar
3. Click **▶ Start Detection**
4. When an accident is detected:
   - 🚨 Red border appears on the video feed
   - 📱 SMS + voice call sent to emergency responder
   - 📧 Emails sent to all hospitals with an **Accept Case** button
   - 👮 Police notified by email
5. A hospital clicks **Accept** → other hospitals are notified the case is handled

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| Frontend | Streamlit |
| Object Detection | YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) |
| Video Processing | OpenCV |
| SMS & Voice Call | Twilio |
| Email Alerts | Gmail SMTP |
| Audio Alerts | gTTS |
| Environment Config | python-dotenv |

## 📍 Default Accident Location

Currently configured for:
> **NH 66, Ernakulam, Kerala — 10.0159° N, 76.3419° E**

To change the location, update `ACCIDENT_LOCATION` and `MAPS_LINK` in `alert.py`.

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file — it contains sensitive credentials
- The `.gitignore` already excludes `.env`
- `ACTIVE_CASES` is stored in-memory — it resets when the app restarts
- Trial Twilio accounts can only SMS to verified numbers
- The YOLOv8 model detects: `car`, `truck`, `bus`, `motorcycle`, `bicycle`
